AnyDeck is a root Decky Loader plugin for AMD x86 handhelds running SteamOS.

The goal is simple: make a non-Steam-Deck handheld feel closer to a Steam Deck without faking support, shipping mystery presets, or silently writing system state behind the user’s back.

Current release line: `0.2.0-alpha.8`

## What It Is

AnyDeck brings together the controls and diagnostics that matter most on a SteamOS handheld:

- native SteamOS performance profile switching
- display sync controls such as VRR and V-Sync when gamescope exposes them
- live FPS limit control
- CPU Boost, SMT, charge-limit, battery, thermal, and device diagnostics
- RGB control across supported sysfs and HID backends
- rollback-aware system optimizations with explicit per-toggle state
- a backend that is now split into focused services instead of living entirely in one monolithic file

## Project Status

This project is still alpha, but it is no longer a proof of concept.

What alpha means here:

- hardware coverage is still expanding
- some controls depend on SteamOS interfaces that can vary by build
- validated coverage is stronger on a few families than on the wider handheld market
- UI polish and wording are still moving

## Support Model

AnyDeck is intentionally SteamOS-first.

Today the plugin:

- requires SteamOS `3.8+`
- blocks Steam Deck hardware to avoid overriding Valve defaults
- only enables on official SteamOS builds, not SteamOS-like derivatives
- fully validates support on ASUS and Lenovo handhelds already mapped by the project
- exposes experimental support on other non-Steam-Deck handhelds it can identify as handheld-class devices

Important detail:

- support is capability-driven
- not every handheld exposes the same RGB, power, display, or SteamOS Manager interfaces
- the UI is supposed to show what is really available on the current machine, not what would be nice to have

## Main Features

### Handheld controls

- SteamOS performance profiles: `low-power`, `balanced`, `performance`
- VRR state
- V-Sync state
- live FPS limit through gamescope
- CPU Boost
- SMT
- battery charge limit
- RGB enabled state, color, brightness, mode, and speed

### Device and runtime information

- handheld identification and support status
- vendor, board, BIOS, CPU, GPU, kernel, and memory details
- battery capacity, health, cycles, voltage, current, and temperature
- estimated time to empty or full when enough live data exists
- current TDP, CPU temperature, GPU temperature, and GPU clock
- runtime diagnostics for host command resolution, display environment, and SteamOS Manager access
- debug log snapshots for user-visible operations

### Optional system optimizations

Each optimization is exposed as a separate toggle with explicit state:

- `LAVD Scheduler`
- `Swap Protection`
- `THP Madvise`
- `NPU Blacklist`
- `USB Wake Guard`
- `AMD P-State`
- `Disable ABM`
- `Split Lock Mitigation`
- `NMI Watchdog`
- `PCIe ASPM`

The plugin distinguishes between:

- `enabled`: AnyDeck configured the optimization
- `active`: the optimization is live at runtime
- `available`: the current machine exposes the required interface
- `needs_reboot`: configured state and running state do not match yet

## Feature Backends

| Area | Backend |
| --- | --- |
| Performance profiles | SteamOS Manager DBus |
| VRR / V-Sync | gamescope root properties through `xprop` |
| FPS limit | `gamescopectl` with property fallback for reads |
| Charge limit | SteamOS Manager DBus |
| SMT | SteamOS Manager first, kernel SMT sysfs fallback |
| CPU Boost | SteamOS Manager first, kernel cpufreq boost fallback |
| RGB | multicolor LED sysfs or handheld-specific HID backend |
| Device / battery info | DMI, power supply, kernel, and runtime files |
| Optimizations | managed files, services, sysctl, tmpfiles, ACPI wake, and GRUB |

## RGB Support

RGB support is backend-aware rather than one-size-fits-all.

Current support includes:

- multicolor LED sysfs backends
- Legion Go / Legion Go S HID backends
- ASUS Ally style HID backends

Capabilities vary by backend:

- some backends only expose `solid`
- HID backends can expose `pulse`, `rainbow`, or `spiral`
- speed controls only appear when the selected mode really supports speed

## Optimization Model

Optimizations are managed explicitly and designed to be reversible.

Managed configuration currently uses:

- atomic manifest: `/etc/atomic-update.conf.d/anydeck.conf`
- persistent optimization state: `/var/lib/anydeck/optimization-state.json`

The plugin keeps enough previous state to roll back important runtime changes where possible, including examples such as:

- prior SCX config
- prior sysctl memory values
- prior THP mode
- prior ACPI wake-enabled devices
- kernel parameters that existed before AnyDeck changed GRUB

### USB Wake Guard

`USB Wake Guard` uses the kernel ACPI wake interface directly through:

- a managed systemd unit
- a managed helper script
- a managed config file listing the ACPI USB wake devices to disable

This is intentionally more native and more durable than embedding opaque shell one-liners straight into a service definition.

## Architecture

The backend is no longer just a giant `main.py`.

Key pieces already extracted:

- [platform_support.py](platform_support.py)
- [rgb_support.py](rgb_support.py)
- [rgb_controller.py](rgb_controller.py)
- [system_info.py](system_info.py)
- [optimization_support.py](optimization_support.py)
- [optimization_ops.py](optimization_ops.py)
- [optimization_runtime.py](optimization_runtime.py)
- [performance_service.py](performance_service.py)
- [display_service.py](display_service.py)
- [state_aggregator.py](state_aggregator.py)

`main.py` still orchestrates the plugin, but much less raw logic is trapped in it than before.

## Privilege Model

AnyDeck is intended to run with Decky root mode:

```json
"flags": ["_root"]
```

in [plugin.json](plugin.json).

That means:

- Decky should launch the backend as root
- protected writes can then happen directly when the user explicitly requests them

The installer does not create extra `sudoers` or `polkit` rules. If the backend is not actually running as root, some protected operations may fall back to `sudo -n`, but that is not the preferred deployment path.

## Installation

### Install the latest published alpha

```bash
bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neokura/AnyDeck/main/install.sh)
```

The installer expects:

- `curl`
- `python3`
- `unzip`
- a working Decky Loader installation

It installs to:

```text
$HOME/homebrew/plugins/AnyDeck
```

### Install a specific version

```bash
bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neokura/AnyDeck/main/install.sh) 0.2.0-alpha.8
```

## First Launch Behavior

AnyDeck does not silently apply a default tuning profile during installation or first boot.

On startup it reads real state from:

- SteamOS Manager
- gamescope
- sysfs
- DMI
- ACPI and runtime files
- runtime command probes

The UI should first describe the device as it is, then only write system state when the user asks for a change.

## Development

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm run typecheck
pnpm test
pnpm run build
```

Create a release zip locally with:

```bash
./release.sh
```
